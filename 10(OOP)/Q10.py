# 10. Multiple Inheritance
# Problem: Create two classes Battery and Engine,
# and let the ElectricCar class inherit from both, demonstrating multiple inheritance.

class Battery:
    def battery_info(self):
        return("Battery Available")
class Engine:
    def engine_info(self):
        return("Engine Available")
class ElectricCar(Battery, Engine):
    pass
my_car = ElectricCar()
print(my_car.battery_info())
print(my_car.engine_info())
